# Ansible

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a configuration management tool that can be used to configure **bare metal** servers with the right software.

Ansible has fundametal differences to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), a provisioning tool.

:::

## Installation

In the control panel server (`194.95.75.10`), run

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
    ansible
```

## Inventory

Ansible requires a list of servers that it can access. Edit `/etc/ansible/hosts` to be like

```ansible
[methodshub]
194.95.75.9
```

Check that your inventory is correct:

```bash
ansible all --list-hosts
```

```
  hosts (1):
    194.95.75.9
```

Add public SSH keys to the servers:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible@notebooks.gesis.org"
```

```bash
ssh-copy-id iuser@194.95.75.9
```

Check that the servers are accessible:

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

```
194.95.75.9 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
