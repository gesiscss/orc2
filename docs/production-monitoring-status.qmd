# Monitoring Status

## GitLab

A couple of Python scripts (see `test` directory) check basic reply from GESIS Notebooks and can run periodically.

First, create a access token to <https://github.com/gesiscss/orc2-test-build> by following the [instructions on GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Save the access token as (GESIS GitLab CI/CD)[https://git.gesis.org/ilcm/orc2/-/settings/ci_cd] variable under the name `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

[Schedule a new pipeline in GESIS GitLab](https://git.gesis.org/ilcm/orc2/-/pipeline_schedules/new) to run every hour. `.gitlab-ci.yml` is already configured to only run some jobs on schedule pipelines.

The result of the schedule pipelines will be listed in GESIS GitLab at <https://git.gesis.org/ilcm/orc2/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&source=schedule>.
