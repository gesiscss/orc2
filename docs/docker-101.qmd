# Docker 101

Docker images and containers can use a huge amount of storage space. It's important to remove old images preriodically.

## Configuration

:::{.callout-note}

Docker runs as a daemon and more information is available at <https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/>.

:::

First, stop the Docker daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

The configuration file is `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.

Last, start the Docker daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

## Remove all resources

:::{.callout-note}

This can take a lot of time.

:::

```bash
docker system prune --force --all
```
