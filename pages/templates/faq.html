<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>GESIS Notebooks Overview</h3>
<h4>Who can use this service?</h4>

<h4>Is the service free?</h4>
<p> The service is free for social scientists. In the future GESIS may include a premium offer with additional features. </p>
<h4>What languages/environments can be on the service? Can I use my preferred R, Julia or Python environment?</h4>
<p> You can select any language/environment available from our gallery of more than 5000 <a href='/gallery/' target='_blank'>binder-ready projects</a>. The gallery contains projects from the <a href='https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org' target='_blank'>MyBinder.org Events Archive</a>. </p>
<h4>What are the service&#39;s restrictions?</h4>
<p> For the anonymous use of via Binder, the service has a limit of: <br>
<ul>

<h4>I have a question or have found a bug. Where can I open up an Issue?</h4>
<p> For questions regarding Jupyter or the Binder import, join the <a href='https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/binder' target='_blank'>discussion</a>, read the <a href='https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/' target='_blank'>docs</a> or see the <a href='https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub' target='_blank'>code</a>. Please open an issue on our <a href='https://github.com/gesiscss/orc/issues' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a> for questions regarding GESIS Notebooks. We are looking forward to hearing from you.<br>If possible, please include:
<ul>

<h4>Can I host my own version of this platform?</h4>
<p> The project is open-source and the code is available at <a href='https://github.com/gesiscss/orc2' target='_blank'>https://github.com/gesiscss/orc2</a>. </p>
<h4>Where can I create a JupyterHub API token?</h4>
<p> You can use <a href='/hub/token' target='_blank'>token request page</a> to create a JupyterHub API token. You can also read more about the JupyterHub API in the <a href='https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/rest.html' target='_blank'>JupyterHub docs</a>, how to make an API request and the different ways you can use the API. </p>
<h4>How can I export my data?</h4>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch <em>gh/gesiscss/data_science_image</em> and start a terminal</li>
  <li>Run <em>zip -r ~/myprojects.zip /projects/*</em> in the terminal</li>
  <li>Go to the Notebook dashboard, select <em>myprojects.zip</em> file and download</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Binder Project Import </h3>
<h4>What is Binder?</h4>
<p> Binder is an open-source project that enables the creation of shareable, interactive, reproducible scientific analysis environments. You can read more about Binder <a href='https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html' target='_blank'>here</a>. </p>
<h4>How can I manage my projects?</h4>
<p> After launching a new repository, it will appear in Your Projects:
<ol>
  <li>Concurrently store up to 5 projects</li>
  <li>Control the projects you are currently working on</li>
  <li>Directly link to the project repositories</li>
</ol><img alt='GESIS Notebooks' src='/static/images/faq/YourProjects.png?v=123456' class='img-responsive center-block' id='faq-img'>
</p>
<h4>Where can I find binder-ready projects?</h4>
<p> The Binder Federation maintains a machine readable <a href='https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org/' target='_blank'>archive</a> of projects that are binder-ready and suited for the import in GESIS Notebooks. A gallery for you to browse is available at <a href='/gallery/' target='_blank'>https://notebooks.gesis.org/gallery/</a>. </p>
<h4>How can I make my Notebooks binder-ready?</h4>
<p> For more information about making a Notebook binder-ready, take a look at the <a href='https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#how-to-guides-and-tutorials' target='_blank'>binder user guide</a>. </p>
<h4>How can I create a direct launch link for my notebooks?</h4>
<p> Just like <a href='https://mybinder.org'>mybinder.org</a>, you can create a direct launch link for a notebook repository. To launch the notebook without persistence (no login required) you can create a URL like https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/github_account_name/repository_name/HEAD with appropriate 'github_account_name' and 'repository_name'. To launch this with persistence (login required) you can construct a URL with https://notebooks.gesis.org/services/binder/v2/gh/github_account_name/repository_name/HEAD. </p>
